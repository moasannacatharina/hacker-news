## üç≠ Code Review

**Comments by Jon McGarvie**

- `PHP Warning: Undefined array key "id"` in multiple places. Find in console.
- When you first enter the website it signs you in as an empty user, which means you can't see the login button until you log out.
- On `index.php:5` you can do `SELECT posts.*, users.email ...` to select everything from posts (and of course users.email).
- On the post feed you should have the url next to the title so you don't go in completely blind.
- Good solution for the upvotes, as you don't have to reload the site in order to upvote.
- You should make it so that when you make a post it redirects you to that specific post.
- Good error messages.
- After you register or login a user you should unset the password variables so that they cannot be accessed.
- Good icons for editing and deleting comments.
- Don't really get why the profile picture is visable on posts.
